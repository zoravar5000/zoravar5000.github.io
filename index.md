### Sector 1: Xbox
> FORZA HORIZON 5: with the doughnut media month coming to an end, we see new cars and a holiday special month returning. Also the Auction house is back after the money hack has been repaired.

> MINECRAFT: with two new mobs from the wild update, one being the warden which brings a new biome Ancient City and the Frog plus Allay.  There are more biomes like the Lush Caves and the Mangrove Forest.  There are also new skins being added to the java launcher Noor, Sunny, Ari, Zuri, Makena, Kai, and Efe. To wrap up, the mob vote will be announced between the Tuff Golem, Rascal, and the sniffer.
