# Egg Nog Review #1 11/2021

Name: Bud's Ice Cream of San Francisco Egg Nog Since 1932

1. i have lived in the bay area my whole life and i have never heared of BUD'S icecream of San Francisco and they call themselves famous?!?!??
1. it's egg nog! not ice cream!
1. the day you open it it is nice and heavy however, the next day it gets too light
1. the day you open it i will say it was pretty good but not super good

### Rating
nutmeg 10nogs (not to much not to less)
thickness 7.5 nogs (could be a bit thicker)
aroma OK

**Overall**: i give it a 8 nogs out of 10 nogs (10 is the best)

(one quart is not very much i finished it in two days)
